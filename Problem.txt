1.

model.js line number 54 to 81
problem is await is not working in async function .It will perform after return value from async function.
I also problem with some example of value x in line 54 and 55

I make one object of database schema and save it in database  by save function but that function execute after return 
the va;ue so I am not able to know that it is saved successfully or not.

I can't solve this error
But..
For continue the code and for run the code i used alternate solution of try and catch(line 46 to 51).
if function execute then return value 
or something went wrong.So I get a idea about function is executed succesfully or not



2.
I put validation on contact number that it is have to int and lenth is equal to 10.
but whenever I submit form if will come in String format always.
even In index.js from where I submit in this page line 23 Can see that I wrote input type 'tel'.

I can't solve this error
But..
I use parseInt funtion(controller.js line 44) who convert in int also remove alphabates from value.
